SEKI-at-home
============

With SEKI@home, which stands for Search for Embedded Knowledge Items, we propose a generic, browser extension-based approach for crowdsourcing the task of knowledge extraction from arbitrary Web pages. As people with the extension installed browse a targeted Web page, the extension sends extracted knowledge items according to the customizable extraction rules to a centralized, optionally publicly accessible triple store. Thereby, simply by browsing the Web as usual, participants in the knowledge extraction task can help make previously locked-in knowledge openly accessible, e.g., via the standard SPARQL protocol. We have implemented and made available a prototype browser extension, which, after customization and adaptation, can serve as the basis for future knowledge extraction tasks.
